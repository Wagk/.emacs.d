;; This file is a file that contains information that pertains to this local

;; should not be assumed to guarantee exist

;; This file should be one of the first things that init.el loads, and hence
;; shouldn't depend on anything that init.el loads

;; Known keywords that the config currently uses are:
;; - `config-local-dropbox-folder' :: The path to the dropbox directory

(message "local.el is currently unconfigured!")

;; (defconst config-local-syncthing-folder "/mnt/c/Users/pangt.ADS/Sync")
;; (defconst config-local-dropbox-folder "/mnt/c/Users/pangt.ADS/Dropbox")

;; fullscreen if you want it
;; (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(fullscreen . maximized))
;; (toggle-frame-fullscreen)
;; (toggle-frame-maximized)

;; Pre-init local declarations go here

;; This file is a file that contains information that pertains to this local

;; should not be assumed to guarantee exist

;; This file should be one of the first things that init.el loads, and hence
;; shouldn't depend on anything that init.el loads

;; Known keywords that the config currently uses are:
;; - `config-local-dropbox-folder' :: The path to the dropbox directory

;; Pre-init local declarations go here

;; (defconst config-local-dropbox-folder
;;   (directory-file-name "..."))

;; Post-init local declarations go here

;; (defun my-after-init-payload ()
;;   "Things to do after the init files are loaded"

  This was created through org-capture. With proper bindings I think I can get used to this
* TODO Remove uses of `:after` from use-packages

  `(require '*)` is better and probably what I actually want
* TODO Delete commented old configs in init.el
* DONE Get orgmode to recognise C-RET to insert headings in normal mode
  Rebound "RET" instead, since in terminals C-RET gets aliased to RET anyway

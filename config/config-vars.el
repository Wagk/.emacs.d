;;; config-vars.el ---

;;; Commentary:

;; The values are placed here so that all internal code should refer to these
;; variables instead of "local.el", so we can put all the checks in one place
;; and not make a mess of things

;;; Code:

  "Notes directory. Mostly used for `deft-directory'.
This is different from the org-directory because these documents are more for
snippets and smaller things"
